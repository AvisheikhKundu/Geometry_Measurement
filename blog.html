                    <p>Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM (Document Object Model). It happens when an element receives an event, and that event bubbles up (or you can say is transmitted or propagated) to its parent and ancestor elements in the DOM tree until it gets to the root element.</p>

                    <h3>What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h3>
                    <p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. The above example is a synchronous callback, as it is executed immediately</p>
                    <p>When you want one function to execute only after another function has completed its execution, we use callback functions in JavaScript. It needs to pass as a parameter to other functions to make a function callback</p>
